//Kaprekars Constant

// Have the function KaprekarsConstant(num) take the num parameter being passed
// which will be a 4 - digit number with at least two distinct digits.

// Your program should perform the following routine on the number: 
// Arrange the digits in descending order and 
// in ascending order(adding zeroes to fit it to a 4 - digit number) and 
// subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. 
// Then repeat the previous step.

// Performing this routine will always cause you to reach a fixed number: 6174.

// Your program should return the number of times this routine must be performed
// until 6174 is reached.

exports.KaprekarsConstant = (num) => {

  // code goes here
